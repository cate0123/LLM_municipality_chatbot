" **LLM_municipality_chatbot**"

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for an AI-driven chatbot designed to enhance public service delivery for rural municipalities in South Africa. The project implements a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot that can interact with citizens through municipal websites, providing information, answering queries, and assisting with service requests.


The project is part of a research initiative titled:
**“A Framework for AI-Driven Public Service Delivery: Integrating LLM Chatbots into Rural Municipality Websites in South Africa.”**


Key Features:
•	Citizen Interaction: Enables residents to access municipal services and information via a conversational interface.
•	AI-Powered Responses: Uses a Large Language Model to understand and respond to diverse queries in a natural, context-aware manner.
•	Framework for Deployment: Includes guidelines for integrating chatbots into rural municipal websites to improve accessibility and efficiency.
•	Scalable & Adaptable: Designed to be extended for different municipalities and service types.
This project demonstrates how AI and LLM technologies can bridge the digital service gap in rural areas, fostering transparency, efficiency, and citizen engagement.
